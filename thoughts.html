			<p>On Tuesday April 23rd 2013, the twitter account of the Associated Press was hacked. Subsequently, the hackers tweeted that President Obama had been hurt in a bombing at the White House. Following this tweet, the Dow Jones plummeted nearly 100 points within minutes (a drop equal to nearly 200 billion dollars). The exchange recovered for the most part after learning that the Associated Press tweet was the result of a hack on their Twitter account.</p>

			<p>One must realize, however, that the Dow Jones did not lose points because its traders got scared. The Dow Jones lost points because its computer algorithms received word of an attack on the White House and acted accordingly. It bounced back because the same algorithms received word of the hack and subsequently reacted accordingly.</p>

			<p>All of this happened within minutes. And it is largely the result of being able to make trades within milliseconds. Twitter serves as a platform. It does not serve as a fact checking platform.</p> 

			<p>Following the hack, Twitter began implementing a two step approach to user authentication and verification. However, I do not think it is legitimate or responsible to solely blame Twitter. If Twitter chose to implement a new verification method, should the markets do the same? If they don’t, can someone else hack a news agencies account, predict what stocks will be effected, buy low immediately after the attack and sell high minutes later?</p>

			<p>How easy is it for you to send information to someone without it being traceable? What would be your first attempt? Would you hit *67 before you place a phone call … so that it comes up as an unknown number on the receiver’s caller ID? Would you set up a new gmail account prior to emailing someone?</p>
			<p>Common low-tech recommendations:</p>
			<p>1. Use a public computer with fresh accounts that have a pseudonym prior to establishing familiarity, legitimacy, and ultimately identity with the receiver.</p>
			<p>2. Use a public telephone. Place a handkerchief over your face when speaking (in case there are cameras monitoring the use of the telephone). Note: There are cameras everywhere.</p>
			<p>3. Meet in person. Hand over documents. Walk away.</p>
			<p>Relatively new hi-tech options:</p>
			<p>1. Use a service that is similar to snapchat but for whistleblowers. These apps are readily available. They do not store any information from your phone, the message that you are sending, the person receiving the message, or the person sending the message. In fact, the message will even disappear from the receivers phone after a pre-set length of time (determined by the sender). </p>
			<p>— Examples of these apps: Wickr, TigerText, BurnNote, GiGi, S2end. </p>
			<p>2. While these services offer anonymity, whistleblowing important information gains legitimacy based on identity and authenticity. Use these service to establish contact and then go low tech.</p> 
			<p>3. Look for services that not only destroy the message after a preset length of time but also make it impossible for the person to record the information during the preset time (think: screenshots).</p>
