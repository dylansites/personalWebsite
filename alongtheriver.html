				<p><em>Along The River</em> is a small collection of black and white photographs taken within and beside the Metro North train as it made it's journey north alongside the Hudson River in the fall of 2009. The majority of these images were taken in the late afternoon sun, right before sunset. If nothing else, this project provided an open space, both geographically and mentally, in which I was able to reflect on the new life in Manhattan that I was hesitant to embark upon.</p>
