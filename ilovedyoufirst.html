				<p>There is an unspoken agreement within close relationships that those involved will never abandon one another. When this trust is broken there is a lasting effect on both parties. This project revolves around this unspoken agreement and the effect that its breaking has had on myself and those closest to me. These images are honest, they show good times and bad times, but they are subjective. As with all family photo albums, I am displaying events that I want to remember.</p>
