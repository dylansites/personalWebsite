				<p>The photographs in this collection are remnants of joyous occasions. They serve as memories of birthday parties, Christmas mornings, vacations, as well as unexpected moments between loved ones and strangers. They provide evidence that these moments happened, that life is not dictated by unfortunate events. They remind me that at one point everything seemed fine and that maybe there is no clarification regarding lifeâ€™s turmoils to be found by looking at the past.</p>

				<p><em>In Retrospect; Everything Seemed Fine</em> is a small collection of black and white photographs taken between 2011 and the present.</p>
